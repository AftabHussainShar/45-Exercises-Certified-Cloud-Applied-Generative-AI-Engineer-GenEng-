// Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in an array, and
// then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
// â€¢ Modify your loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the name of
// the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like
// pepperoni pizza

for (var i = 0; i < favoritePizzas.length; i++) {
